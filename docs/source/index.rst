Welcome to Amazon paapi5's documentation!
*****************************************

Amazon paapi5 is a thin, well-tested, maintained, and powerful Python wrapper over the Amazon Product Advertising API. There is practically no overhead, and no magic (unless you add it yourself).

Before you get started, make sure you have both Amazon Product Advertising and AWS accounts. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG are all from your Amazon Associate Account.

- Support for AU, BR, CA, FR, IN, IT, JP, MX, ES, TR, MX, AE, UK and US Amazon Product Advertising API endpoints
- Configurable throttling for batches of queries
- Ask for new features through the `issues <https://github.com/alefiori82/amazon-paapi5/issues>`_ section.
